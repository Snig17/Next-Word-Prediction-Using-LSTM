# Next-Word-Prediction-Using-LSTM
Next word prediction using LSTM is a natural language processing task where a neural network model, typically built with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, is trained to predict the upcoming word or words in a sequence of text. It leverages the model's ability to capture contextual dependencies in language, enabling it to suggest the most likely next word based on the preceding words, making it valuable in applications like auto-completion and language generation.
