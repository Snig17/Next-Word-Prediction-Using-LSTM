# Next-Word-Prediction-Using-LSTM
Next word prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves training a neural network, specifically an LSTM-based model, to predict the most likely word or sequence of words that will come after a given input text.

This predictive model leverages the sequential nature of language by capturing dependencies and context from the previous words in the input. LSTM networks are particularly well-suited for this task because they can handle long-range dependencies and avoid the vanishing gradient problem.
